 For the moment you are armed with nothing but a shield.\
 Your task is not to attack, but to successfully protect yourself from harm with your shield.\

 He will try his best to knock you unconscious, while you must protect yourself with your shield\

 You can press the Tab key at any time to return to the tutorial menu."),

  ("tutorial_3_msg_1","This tutorial is intended to give you an overview of parrying and defence without a shield.\
 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\
 When you are defending with a weapon, you are only protected from one direction, the direction in which your weapon is set.\
 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\
 Either of these attacks would still be able to hit you.\
 That's why, in order to survive without a shield, you must learn directional defence.\
 Go pick up up the quarterstaff now to begin practice."),
  ("tutorial_3_msg_2","By default, the direction in which you defend (by clicking and holding your right mouse button) is determined by the attack direction of your closest opponent.\
 For example, if your opponent is readying a thrust attack, pressing and holding the right mouse button will parry thrust attacks, but not side or overhead attacks.\
 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\
 Now it's time for you to move on to the next room, where you'll have to defend yourself against an armed opponent.\
 Your task is to defend yourself successfully for thirty seconds with no equipment other than a simple quarterstaff.\
 Your quarterstaff's attacks are disabled for this tutorial, so don't worry about attacking and focus on your defence instead.\
 Move on to the next room when you are ready to initiate the fight."),

 Try to remain standing for thirty seconds. You have {reg3} seconds to go."),

 Try to remain standing for thirty seconds. You have {reg3} seconds to go."),

 Defeat him by a combination of attack and defence."),
  ("tutorial_3_2_msg_2","Defeat your opponent with your quarterstaff."),
  ("tutorial_3_2_msg_3","Excellent. Now the only thing standing in your way is one last opponent.\
 He is in the next room. Move in and knock him down."),

  ("tutorial_3_2_msg_5","Well done! In this tutorial you have learned how to fight ably without a shield.\

 You can press the Tab key at any time to return to the tutorial menu."),

 We'll start by getting you mounted up.\
 Approach the horse, and press the 'F' key when you see the word 'Mount'."),

 Ride your horse and try to follow the yellow flag around the course.\
 When you reach the flag, it will move to the next waypoint on the course until you reach the finish."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_3","Very good. Next we'll cover attacking enemies from horseback. Approach the yellow flag now."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_4","Draw your sword (using the mouse wheel) and destroy the four targets.\
 Try hitting the dummies as you pass them at full gallop -- this provides an extra challenge,\
 but the additional speed added to your blow will allow you to do more damage.\
 The easiest way of doing this is by pressing and holding the left mouse button until the right moment,\
 releasing it just before you pass the target."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_5","Excellent work. Now let us try some target shooting from horseback. Go near the yellow flag now."),
  ("tutorial_4_msg_6","Locate the archery target beside the riding course and shoot it three times with your bow.\

  ("npc1_backstory_a", "You come at a difficult time, friend. Ithilien is flooded by enemy scouts and raiders, and some had seen great hosts of orcs on the move. We do try to prevent the foul creatures from crossing the great river and I have led a group of skilled Rangers to many a success. My Captain Faramir is bold and I don't despair of the Shadow hanging over us."),
  ("npc2_backstory_a", "Ah, how graceful to inquire about me. I have been newly assigned as a guard of His Stewardship's hallways, a proud duty, if I may say so, if not very eventful."),
  ("npc3_backstory_a", "Well, my old helmet here is getting smaller by the minute and the ground seems wobbly as if I rode a mischievous foil. Ah, if I only hadn't drank all that ale last night - I normally have a good head for drink, so it must have been some nasty orc brew."),
  ("npc4_backstory_a", "My name is Gálmynë, and I made it my business to know yours, {playername}. Let me explain why."),
  ("npc5_backstory_a", "You may have heard tales of my deeds in battles past and forgotten by mortal Men. In the fullness of time this War is yet another time of danger for the Eldar, but it will be the Last War."),
  ("npc6_backstory_a", "Excuse my brashness, stranger, but we don't have many visitors here and those that come do not look very trustworthy. Only a week ago, this dwarf appeared and... Never mind. My name is Luevanna, of the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood."),
  ("npc7_backstory_a", "Polite of you to ask, {playername}. We are fighting off incursions from Easterlings and Gundabad orcs, but so far nothing we and our Dale allies can't handle."),
  ("npc8_backstory_a", "I'm sure you can find some fine volunteers if you speak to the quartermaster in the barracks. As for me, I'm merely a healer and herbalist of modest skills."),
  ("npc9_backstory_a", "Good for you! They call me Gulm. I have gutted my sergeant and his snaga s now hunt for me.^The worthless piglet had it coming! Once, we got ambushed by a strawheads patrol... and he lost it. 'Fall back' he screams, then flees. Only Gulm and a few others stood firm, and broke their horses charge. Then we bludgeoned the yellow-haired into paste (heh heh heh). But if it wasn't for us strong ones, all would be worm food!"),
  ("npc10_backstory_a", "I am Durgash!"),
  ("npc11_backstory_a", "Nar! Not a tracker, that's who. They threw me out! I tell you they've lost their heads, that's what it is. Curse 'em! First they say I shoot wild, then I run too slow, and then I have a useless snuffler. Garn! If they don't find a rabble for me soon I'll be for the Black Pits, if what I hear is true. I'll make sure some of those Bosses lose their skins sooner than putting me in there!"),
  ("npc12_backstory_a", "I'm in command of a band of lads up here. I'm Gorbag and you'd best learn quick lubber us Uruks are the real bosses 'round here. The Big Bosses makes slips, 'ay, even the Biggest can make mistakes, and always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. They don't even tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. Grr!"),
  ("npc13_backstory_a", "I? I am a grain of soil from southern sands, blown north by cold and dark night winds. I am Lykyada, a Serpent Lord of Haradwaith. Lord of the Gold Serpent, bane of the Black Serpent Tribe, now allied to serve the will of the Dark Lord."),
  ("npc14_backstory_a", "I am Fuldimir, son of the southern realm of Umbar, south of Harondor, and the Bay of Belfalas, for both are home to my heart and my people. We are the lords of sea and sail, corsairs to some, kin of the Bay of Belfalas for her waters we tame."),
  ("npc15_backstory_a", "I am Bolzog the Gifted, Setter of Bones, Closer of Cuts, and Shaman of Healing. If you go to war for The Eye, you will no doubt have one or other of your little fellows cut about a bit by pale-faced foresters or the horse-lovers. Now, -nar-nar-nar! - Orcs are easy to replace, Oh Great Leader, but can you replace a Warg? A Giant? A Cave Troll? Shi-shi! No! You need me, the Great Bolzog!"),
  ("npc16_backstory_a", "Well now, it is the stranger who should declare himself first. Nevertheless, I am Varfang of the Balcoth kin... I can tell that you have not yet heard the songs or tales of my land that speak the name of the Balcoth, for the very name would check your courage and fill your heart with woe."),
  ("npc17_backstory_a", "They call me Dímborn and I work in the woods. It is nice there. I like the woods. Many trees in the woods. I like trees. I've worked in the woods all my life, because I am strong and because I like trees."),

#backstory main body
  ("npc1_backstory_b", "You should know that I am an Ithilien Ranger of Dúnedain descent and valor. I know much of tracking and scouting and my skill with bow and sword is known to the orc. I can also train any soul that's willing to fight the coming Shadow."),
  ("npc2_backstory_b", "I have been trained as a Minas Tirith watchman, to keep order in the White City and serve my lord Steward."),
  ("npc3_backstory_b", "I am a Rider of the Westfold éored - they left without me on a long patrol to the Isen fords. I know their conduct will be worthy of the green banner, but I fear many won't return."),
  ("npc4_backstory_b", "I was born into a noble family and I have been serving Lady Éowyn as a maid of honour ever since we were little girls. Our fathers were wise enough to allow us to train alongside our brothers in matters of combat, to become shieldmaidens of Rohan."),
  ("npc5_backstory_b", "Lord Elrond sent me as an emissary to Lord Celeborn, to give aid and advice as it's needed in the War in this part of Rhovanion."),
  ("npc6_backstory_b", "I like to walk the hidden paths in our beautiful forest. Sometimes I move quietly through the trees and observe the habits of the many woodland animals. The song of a rare bird, the nesting of a wild boar are as beautiful to me as the clash of weapons and great walls are to the Edain."),
  ("npc7_backstory_b", "I helped improve the Erebor defenses and trained some younger dwarven folk, under the direction of my venerated father Dwalin, as is our custom."),
  ("npc8_backstory_b", "I have treated my King Brand for constipation, a common malaise affecting men going to war. A light brew of wormwood, and both the bowels and the mind are put at ease."),
  ("npc9_backstory_b", "So I said to myself, 'Gulm, you want end up as carrion?' and I answered, 'No'.^Next battle, I fell back pretending I was injured. Then, with no one watching, I fell upon my sergeant! Cleaved him almost in half, gharr! Then cut his sidekick snaga nicely^^...Turned out that bloody creeper survived somehow, and started waggling his tongue about all this. Next time I make sure his head is off, gharr..."),
  ("npc10_backstory_b", "I am a Wolf Rider of Isengard and a tracker."),
  ("npc11_backstory_b", "Ar! It's only 'cause my nose was snotty. An' what good is it wearing my nose out on stones anyhow? Nar! It was those filthy Uruks! Those cursed peaching sneakthiefs! I only lost the scent through giving way to them. They messed up the scent back there, pinching anything they found, and stomping all round the place before I could get there."),
  ("npc12_backstory_b", "And those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving in the city. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em."),
  ("npc13_backstory_b", "I saw of late the word of the Dark Lord spread among my kin, and in their hearts and minds his will crept. Most were drawn to his darkness, and in place of their courage grew an insatiable lust for slaughter so that when their ears heard his call few puppets were so willing to answer."),
  ("npc14_backstory_b", "There is much change in a man who rides the tumult of the winds and seas of the Belfalas waters, and those yet to battle her will are but children. For stout men are they who meet her tempest and ride her storm. I have laid eyes on her darkest tide and yet remain her master."),
  ("npc15_backstory_b", "Many moons ago, when I was just a fresh little thing, my Grandsire led the tribe down into the mines, where the dwarves had recently died. A Fire Wraith had passed through, and it was comfortable and warm. We prospered, but every so often some cruel adventurer, or Dwarf hero, would come and kill and maim us in our peaceful tunnels. My hands learned to close the wound of sword or axe, and my mind learned to see the outline of bone and sinew below any hide. These days, I can work a potion or set a break with equal skill."),
  ("npc16_backstory_b", "The Balcoth were a fierce race of men from my home land, slaughtered by these westerlings to all but a few men. Chased down like beasts of burden as food for their blades. The blood spilt by those blades is the same blood that flows within me, for within me their house continues."),
  ("npc17_backstory_b", "You can make many things out of the trees, you know. It's what I do. I work with trees and make things out of trees. Sometimes bushes also. But I like trees more."),

#backstory recruit pitch
  ("npc1_backstory_c", "However, I fear we are hopelessly outnumbered here in Ithilien and we won't last long without reinforcements or bolder action by our Steward. I might as well help where my actions would account for more, if my Captain Faramir gives me leave."),
  ("npc2_backstory_c", "However important my duty here is, I'm quite anxious to see real combat and... elves and talking trees and oliphaunts! You seem well-travelled, commander, and I don't mean that as a slight on your appearance, not by a fathom. I learn quickly and can cook... well, good enough for soldiers that is. Am I not mistaken that you are looking for volunteers?"),
  ("npc3_backstory_c", "So, here I am, disgraced and bitter. My éored must be miles away now, and I wouldn't have a fair chance of catching up with them, not with all the orcs and wildmen roaming the plains. Are you by any chance in need of a fine Rohirrim rider?"),
  ("npc4_backstory_c", "You might know that women, however skilled, are not allowed to ride with the éoredas. However, I do not think that waiting by the hearth for the warriors to return is my fate. I will not sit idle until all chance of great deeds is gone in this War, and I would welcome your assistance, warrior."),
  ("npc5_backstory_c", "However, if the enemies of Lothlórien are on the run, I might consider joining you for a while, {playername}. I sense our fates in this War are interwoven."),
  ("npc6_backstory_c", "You wouldn't understand that, I think, seeing you prepared for war. But you must have travelled far and wide - have you seen the other great forests? Can you take me there?"),
  ("npc7_backstory_c", "There is a lull in the fighting that ill-suits a dwarven warrior of my ancestry and temperament. I gather you get to see much more action in your travels and your cause is friendly with the dwarves? I know a fighting dwarf will greatly improve your chances of survival."),
  ("npc8_backstory_c", "I hear there is much fighting elsewhere and our lands are gratefully spared for now. From the scratches on your armor you must have been in danger many times. Maybe my humble skills could be better used with your company, for the greater good of all."),
  ("npc9_backstory_c", "I am a fighting Uruk-hai, and a berserker! What there is to know of killing men, I know it. I was in the service of the White Hand, but now the Hand would as likely throw me into the fire-pits.^^I would come with you and hunt men in the south, while the snagas of Isengard gnash their teeth."),
  ("npc10_backstory_c", "Maybe you can be my next master."),
  ("npc11_backstory_c", "All right, all right! My nose isn't much use. I reckon my eyes are better than my nose. Ai! But my nose is only no good cause it don't know what nothing smells like. It don't even know what it's looking for, I tell you. Ar! I just need to go lopin' off and start sniffing places."),
  ("npc12_backstory_c", "Eh, if I get a chance, I'll slip off and set up somewhere on my own with a few trusty lads, somewhere there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em, like old times."),
  ("npc13_backstory_c", "I followed my kin north, and heeded his dark call, to fulfill the duty I have to my people. But in them I see his darkness dwell and I seek to do my part in this war elsewhere, until the sands of my time no longer fall. Even now I feel them begin to trickle where before there was a cascade."),
  ("npc14_backstory_c", "But there comes yet the darkest tide, a black tide of shadow, which will rise over these lands such as which no mortal eyes will have seen. This is the tide I seek to master, but I am without a crew hardy enough to ride this storm."),
  ("npc15_backstory_c", "After many winters I came up out of the tunnels, and looked about in the Dark Forests for a good place to live and practice my arts. I was doing fine, until some big ugly bastards with white tattoos – eugh! White! Like an elf face! – big bastards, they were. They fired my little place in the Forest, and I had to hide in the caves again... In here... Say, have you anything to eat? Maybe a nice horse?"),
  ("npc16_backstory_c", "That was many lives of men ago, a different time, but the time for grief and tales are over. The time for my people's retribution has come and I will carve my people's vengeance on the face of these western lands. By my hand, their homes will waste and wither until their clan is no more!"),
  ("npc17_backstory_c", "If you're going into the forest, maybe I come along and tell you about the trees there? Many very interesting trees there, you know."),


### use these if there is a short period of time between the last meeting 
  ("npc1_backstory_later", "I have been leading scouting parties to the south, as far as Emyn Arnen. There is much Enemy activity and many an orc fell to our ambush. Alas, that's only so many orc heads rolling down the gullies, we saw a myriad of foul creatures on the march. I fear for my Ithilien and the fate of Gondor."),
  ("npc2_backstory_later", "We've had a few visitors lately, and there are fewer to come. I reckon that doesn't bode well."),
  ("npc3_backstory_later", "Still no news of my éored, and I'm keen on riding down some orcs."),
  ("npc4_backstory_later", "More riders return with their bodies broken, and I try to give aid where I can. But I still feel trapped in a cage."),
  ("npc5_backstory_later", "Have you reconsidered? The time for the Eldar grows short."),
  ("npc6_backstory_later", "I've been observing a nest of giant spiders for a couple of days. Ugly creatures, they seem at first, but they keep intruders at bay. Did you come to ask me to travel with you?"),
  ("npc7_backstory_later", "Building up defensive walls is worthy of any dwarf. But I need to use my axe too. Soon. Let me come with you."),
  ("npc8_backstory_later", "I made another call to our King, this time for vomiting. I hope his resolve to engage the enemy is not related to his conditions. Do you suffer from constipation and vomiting too?"),
  ("npc9_backstory_later", "What do you think I do? Gulm is sitting here and waiting for some sneaky snaga to stick him in the dark. Take me with you - I will serve well."),
  ("npc10_backstory_later", "Have you reconsidered? I will serve well."),
  ("npc11_backstory_later", "Ar! It was you! I smelt you, I knew you were coming. Tell the Bosses that, will ya? They think since I was kicked out of the trackers that it's safe to flout me, well they're mistaken, I'll put an arrow in their guts first. And whose blames was that? Not mine!"),
  ("npc12_backstory_later", "I have my orders. Any trespasser found by my lads up here are to be stripped; teeth, nails, hair and all. But I've got my watchers. We know there are funny things going on: with the big bosses going off to war, and all that. Big things going on away west, they say. Sitting here doin' nothing is more than my belly's worth."),
  ("npc13_backstory_later", "My role here goes well for the dark cause, and once more the Northerners fear the south. I see great victories ahead, and rivers of blood left in our wake. But with each victory I see my kin corrupted, their hearts twisted to his evil will. The sight of it leads me to despair."),
  ("npc14_backstory_later", "You have returned stranger, it is perhaps an omen. I have been reading the waters, and I have seen them darken. The sea changes the eyes of a man, and teaches him to use his eyes to listen to her language."),
  ("npc15_backstory_later", "Many have been the great ones who have begged to be healed by my potions.   Horselovers and the pale-faced elves are many though, and I have had to abandon my hut once more, and am... well, Great Lord, I am not so lucky as when we fought together, and you were grateful for my skills..."),
  ("npc16_backstory_later", "Long does the history of my people recount these lands. I know not what their treacherous histories say of days when my people before entered this land, but sad and dark will their histories be as my people enter it now. Like a storm of hooves and swords and arrows, we will bring them doom like the Balcoth before us."),
  ("npc17_backstory_later", "I've seen a very old pine the other day. Pines can get very old. You have to respect old trees. But I've also seen some that don't respect trees at all. You respect trees, don't you?"),

  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_intro",     "I am Lord Kastor, the rightful King of the Rhodoks, who will free them from tyranny."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "I was the only child of my father, King Esterich. Although I am a woman, he loved me like a son and named me his heir -- not once, but several times, before the grandest nobles of the land so that none could doubt his intention. There is no law that bars a woman from ruling -- indeed, we Swadians tell tales of warrior queens who ruled us in our distant past."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "My father died when I was young, leaving me in the care of his brother, the regent Burelek. But rather than hold the throne until I came of age, this usurper used his newfound power to accuse my mother of adultery, and to claim that I was not my father's son. She was executed for treason, and I was declared a bastard."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "Sanjar Khan and I are brothers, sons of the old Janakir Khan, although of different mothers. Although I was the younger brother, all those who knew the old Khan will testify that throughout my father's life, I was his favorite, entrusted with the responsibilities of government. Sanjar busied himself with hunts and feasts to win the affection of the more dissolate of my father's commanders."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1",     "I am called the Far-Seeker because I have travelled great distances, even by the standards of the Nords, in search of knowledge. Before I came of age, my father sent me abroad on a tour of study at the courts and universities in the lands overseas. If the Nords are to call themselves the heirs of the Calradian empire, then they must act the part, and know something of law and letters, and not call themselves content merely to fight, plunder, and drink."),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "The Rhodoks are a free people, and not slaves to any hereditary monarch. The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Jelkala, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Jelkala, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet when my father died, his cousin Harlaus convinced the nobles that no Swadian king of sound mind could name a woman as his heir. Harlaus said that his designation of me was the act of a madman, and thus had no legal standing, and that he, as my father's closest male relative, should of take the throne."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "I was smuggled abroad by a faithful servant, but now I am of age and have returned to reclaim what is rightfully mine. Burelek died soon after his act of perfidy -- the judgment of heaven, no doubt. His son Yaroglek now calls himself king, but as his claim is tainted, he is no less a usurper than his father, and I will topple him from his throne."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "According to Khergit custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Tulga, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Swadian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Harlaus and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the magistrates who ruled in his favor were bought. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who would honour their old king's memory and will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will prove them wrong by taking Harlaus' ill-gotten crown away from him."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Until I have my rights restored in the sight of all the Vaegirs, I will bear the sobriquet, 'the Bastard', to remind me of what I must do."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "My brother thinks that Khergits will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Nords and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!"),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Well, Graveth defeated the Swadians, and for that, as a Rhodok, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Rhodok confederacy and its sacred custom."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Isolla thinks she should be Queen of the Swadians? Well, King Esterich had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted king who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. Isolla may tell you stories of warrior queens of old, but you might also recall that all the old legends end in the same way -- with the Swadians crushed underfoot by the armies of the Calradic Emperor."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Valdym to come to me in peace, I would laden him with titles and honours, and he would become the greatest of my vassals. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge me as rightful sovereign, then cut his tongue from his mouth so that he cannot recant."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My brother Dustum has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Khergits established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "Lethwin 'Far-Seeker'? Lethwin Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Nords to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Lethwin were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!"),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt Lord Kastor told you that I defiled the hallowed Rhodok custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the towns make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes."),

  # ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Those who weep for the plight of a Swadian princess denied her father's throne should reflect instead on the fate of a Swadian herdswoman seized by a Vaegir raider and taken as chattel to the slave markets. Talk to me of queens and old stories when our warlike neighbors are vanquished, and our land is at peace."),
  # ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I have inherited it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war."),
  # ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Dustum would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe."),
  # ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",    "Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his kingdom, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Nords. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  # ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Khergit arrow-wound or a Swadian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'"),

("rohan_rumor_7", "I've seen breeds of the desert mare and Variag horse. Rohan horses are clearly superiour but require a more experienced rider to handle."),
("rohan_rumor_8", "Wargs are slower than horses but can turn faster. They are also quite fragile compared to a well-bred warhorse."),
("rohan_rumor_9", "Armies march on Rohan with pikes and spears set against our fine horsemen. The traitor Saruman will cut down the whole Fangorn forest equipping his armies before this war is over."),
("rohan_rumor_10", "Being the best horsemen in the realm starts with raising the best horses."),
("rohan_rumor_11", "Most of the horses you see in Gondor came from us. They prefer a slightly stronger, slower horse that can carry their heavy armour."),
("rohan_rumor_12", "We say in Rohan that a horse is like a man. That if a horse is good it is like a man is good, and that if a horse is bad, is like a man is bad. And if a horse is hungry is like a man is hungry, and if a horse is sad is like if a man is sad. And we say if a horse is happy is like when a man is happy. We say if a horse is angry is like if man is angry. We say if a horse walk is like when a man walk, we say if a horse is old is like when a man is old, and we say if horse is young is like when a man is young.
